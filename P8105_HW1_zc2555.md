First we need to create a data frame for question 1

``` r
example_df = tibble(
   samp = rnorm(10),
   vector_logical = samp > 0,
   vector_char = c('a','a','a','b','b','b','c','c','c','c'),
   vector_factor = factor(x = vector_char,levels = c('a','b','c'))
)

mean(pull(example_df, samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.4329321

``` r
mean(pull(example_df, vector_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.2

``` r
mean(pull(example_df, vector_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(example_df, vector_char)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(example_df, vector_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(example_df, vector_factor)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The mean of samp is -0.4743189, the mean for vector\_logical is 0.2.
However, for vector\_char and vector\_factor, the pull function did not
work.

Trying to convert variable to numeric type

``` r
as.numeric(pull(example_df, vector_logical))
as.numeric(pull(example_df, vector_char))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(pull(example_df, vector_factor))
```

For variable vector\_char, the conversion failed because vector\_char
are character variables

Q2: Next, we are doing question 2.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The penguins dataset has 5 variables, they are species, island,
bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_lenth\_mm.

The dataset has 344rows and 8columns.

The mean of flipper length is NA

``` r
ggplot(data=penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color=species)) + geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
